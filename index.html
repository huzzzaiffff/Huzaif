            <h1 style="color: aqua;text-align: center;">What is Curve Fitting ?</h1>
            <p style="color: aqua;">Curve fitting in mathematics refers to the process of finding a mathematical function (or curve) that best approximates a set of data points. This technique is used to model and understand relationships between variables, make predictions, and interpolate or extrapolate data. In mathematics, curve fitting typically involves the following key concepts:

               <ol style="color: aqua;"><li>Data Points: You start with a set of data points, usually represented as (x, y) pairs, where x is the independent variable (input) and y is the dependent variable (output).</li>
                
                 <li>Mathematical Model: You choose a mathematical function or equation that you believe might describe the relationship between the variables. The choice of the function depends on the nature of the data and the problem you are trying to solve.</li>
                
                 <li>Parameters: The mathematical model typically has parameters (coefficients) that need to be determined. These parameters determine the shape, position, and behavior of the curve.</li>
                
                 <li>Fitting Process: The goal is to find the values of the model's parameters that minimize the difference between the predicted values of the model and the actual data points. This is usually done by minimizing the sum of squared differences (least squares) between the observed and predicted values.</li>
                
                 <li>Goodness of Fit: To assess how well the curve fits the data, various statistical measures are often used. These measures include the coefficient of determination (R-squared), root mean square error (RMSE), and others.</li>
                
                 <li> Visual Inspection: Visual inspection of the fitted curve compared to the data points is also essential to ensure that the curve captures the essential features of the data.</li></p></ol>

            <h2 style="color: aqua; text-align: center;">Types of Curve Fitting :</h2>
            <p>Common Types of Curve Fitting:

               <ol style="color: aqua;"> <li>Linear Regression: This is one of the simplest forms of curve fitting, where a linear equation (a straight line) is fitted to the data. The equation is typically of the form y = mx + b.</li>
                <img src="./OIP.jpg" height="250px"width="100%">
                <li>Polynomial Regression: Here, a polynomial equation of degree n is fitted to the data. For example, a quadratic polynomial regression might be y = ax^2 + bx + c.</li>
                <img src="./CNX_Precalc_Figure_04_08_0022.jpg" height="250px"width="100%">
                <li>Exponential and Logarithmic Regression: These forms are used when data exhibits exponential growth or decay or follows a logarithmic pattern.</li>
                <img src="./TN3uQ.png" height="250px"width="100%">
                <li>Power Law Regression: This form is used when data follows a power-law distribution, such as y = ax^b.</li>
                <img src="./As-with-Figure-2-but-for-W3_Q640.jpg" height="250px"width="100%">
                <li>Nonlinear Regression: When none of the above models fit the data adequately, more complex nonlinear equations can be used, and specialized techniques are applied to estimate the parameters.
